School

  SynchronizedMaps just in case concurrent editing occurs
Walker
  Recursive walking
  It does not remember past cell as is stored in stack

  The value of distance is decreased as it travels up the stack
  Final distance starts at max value making sure is always larger than distance
SchoolMap
  Reads CSV into 2D array defaulted to walls
  Uses CSV as is compatible with excel, which used to design map
  ClassRoom's must only be adjacent to one traversable cell (path, entrance, classroom)

  Returns optionals to avoid null pointers
  Overwrote toString for debugging
