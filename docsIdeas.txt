Main
  Extends application for JavaFX and overrides methods for compatibility
School
  Is just wrapper to school data such as subjects, staff and map, allows for utility methods
  SynchronizedMaps just in case concurrent editing occurs
Walker
  Recursive walking for simpler code
  It does not remember past cell as is stored in stack
  When fails, it goes up the stack to find cell with possible paths
  The value of distance is decreased as it travels up the stack
  Final distance starts at max value making sure is always larger than distance
SchoolMap
  Uses CSV as is compatible with excel, which used to design map
  ClassRoom's must only be adjacent to one traversable cell (path, entrance, classroom), to avoid unnecessary complexity
  Does not create buildings at creation to avoid stack overflow, instead generates them after map generation and populates the map with buildings
  Returns optionals to avoid null pointers
  Overwrote toString for debugging
ui folder
  JavaFX to create a window containing only a WebView to display the html in the html folder
  Bootstrap and HTML5 is used to make nice ui
SchoolDataParser
  Uses CSV as compatible with excel for ease of modification outside program
  Separated write method in case needs other output, e.g. network, console, SQL
  SynchronizedMaps just in case concurrent editing occurs
